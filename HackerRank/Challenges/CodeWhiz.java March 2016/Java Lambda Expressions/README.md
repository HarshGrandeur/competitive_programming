 Java Lambda Expressions 
 
 his Java 8 challenge tests your knowledge of Lambda expressions!

Write the following methods that return a lambda expression performing a specified action:

    performOperation checkEvenOdd(): The lambda expression must return 00 if a number is even or 11 if it is odd.
    performOperation checkPrime(): The lambda expression must return 00 if a number is prime or 11 if it is composite.
    performOperation checkPalindrome(): The lambda expression must return 00 if a number is a palindrome or 11 if it is not.

Input Format

Input is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor.

Output Format

The locked stub code in your editor will print TT lines of output.

Sample Input

The first line contains an integer, TT (the number of test cases).

The TT subsequent lines each describe a test case in the form of 22 space-separated integers:
The first integer specifies the condition to check for (11 for Odd/Even, 22 for Prime, or 33 for Palindrome). The second integer denotes the number to be checked.
