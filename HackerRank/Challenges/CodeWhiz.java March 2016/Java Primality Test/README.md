 Java Primality Test 
 
 A prime number is a natural number greater than 11 whose only positive divisors are 11 and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are 22, 33, 55, 77, 1111, and 1313.

Given a large integer, nn, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

Input Format

A single line containing an integer, nn (the number to be checked).

Constraints

    1≤|n|≤1001≤|n|≤100

Output Format

If nn is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.

Sample Input

13

Sample Output

prime

Explanation

The only positive divisors of 1313 are 11 and 1313, so we print prime.
