Rotating a Square

This challenge is slightly off the beaten track. Itâ€™s quite simple:
Draw a square on the center of the screen. The size can be any reasonable size of your choice.
If you are programming in C/C++ or Java, have the square rotate when the user presses the down arrow. Once the user presses the top arrow, the square should stop.
If you are programming in front end technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript, have the square stop and start rotating at the click of a mouse button.
