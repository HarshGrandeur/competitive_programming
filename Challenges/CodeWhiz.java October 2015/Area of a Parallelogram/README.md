 Area of a Parallelogram 
 
Problem Statement

You are given a class Solution with a main method. Your task is to complete the given code so that it outputs the area of a parallelogram with breadth B and height H. You should read the variables from standard input.

If B≤0 or H ≤0, the output should be "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.

Input Format

Two lines of input. First line contains B: breadth of parallelogram. Next line contains H: height of parallelogram.

Constraints
−100≤B≤100
−100≤H≤100

Output Format

If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram; else, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.
